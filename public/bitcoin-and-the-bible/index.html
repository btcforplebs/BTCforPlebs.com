      <p>This video explains how Bitcoin’s fixed‑supply, decentralized nature offers a “fairer” alternative to fiat money and how that aligns with biblical principles of truth, honesty, and stewardship. He shares his own journey, a paper he wrote for his church, and the key technical concepts—blocks, mining, proof‑of‑work, public/private keys, and nodes—while tying each to Scripture that warns against debt, encourages integrity, and reminds believers to put Christ first in their financial decisions. The video argues that churches can use Bitcoin for tithing and donations, reducing reliance on a corrupt monetary system, increasing transparency, and enabling worldwide giving, all while reinforcing the moral imperative to steward money as an offering to God rather than a source of pride or greed.</p>

      <p>We explore how Bitcoin’s immutable, scarcity‑based ledger can reflect biblical truths about stewardship, honesty, and faith‑first living. In this first session we establish our ground rules—Christ first, no time‑preferences, and a focus solely on Bitcoin—and we outline the key properties that make it a modern “new money” that aligns with Scripture. Through Scripture‑driven discussion, practical examples (like tithing in BTC), and a look at the real‑world implications of a decentralized, deflationary currency, we’ll lay the foundation for a faith‑centered financial conversation that seeks to honor God, empower the church, and empower each participant to use money as a tool for worship, not a goal.</p>

      <p>In Week 2 the group dives into Episodes 5‑8 of the Bitcoin & The Bible podcast, unpacking how decentralized networks empower community, how Bitcoin’s trust‑based, proof‑of‑work system counters the pitfalls of fiat money, and why a “Bitcoin standard” can restore integrity to our stewardship of God’s gift. We lead with a prayer for financial wisdom, then guides listeners through Biblical principles of generosity, the power of interconnected networks, the reality of money‑making “theft” in traditional finance, and the moral imperative to give directly to the church in a god‑centered way. This session invites believers to re‑imagine their finances as an act of faith—moving from a system of extraction to one of shared truth, transparency, and honest value.</p>

    <section id="week-3">
      <h2>Week 3: “Wisdom, Ownership & the Work of Faith”</h2>

            </video>
        </div>
      <p>We kick off Week 3 by contrasting Proverbs 3:13’s promise that wisdom pays more than silver or gold with the way Bitcoin embodies that truth—finite, transparent, and rooted in God’s own creation of a fair system of value. He then explores the biblical concept of ownership as stewardship: God grants us the right to use the earth’s resources, yet keeps ultimate sovereignty, so our use of money must be honest and just. The session walks through Bitcoin’s technical safeguards—proof‑of‑work, decentralization, and an immutable ledger—showing how these features prevent theft, double‑spending, and the “inflationary” theft of the fiat system. By owning private keys and running nodes, believers exercise a second‑level sovereignty that mirrors God’s mandate to steward wisely, enabling them to give freely (tithe, missions, and community support) without relying on a corrupt middleman. The key takeaway is that Bitcoin is not merely a financial tool but a vehicle for living out God’s commands on honesty, stewardship, and generosity—transforming how Christians manage and share resources in a way that honors God and empowers the church.</p>

        </div>
      <p>The group now turns a spotlight on the intersection of Scripture, civil authority, and the nature of money. Starting with the biblical mandate to submit to governmental authorities (1 Peter 2:13‑17; Romans 13), we explore how the modern fiat system—its endless printing, taxation, and centralized control—contrasts with the biblical ideal of stewardship. He then tackles the paradox of tithing versus taxation, arguing that Bitcoin’s finite, immutable nature gives believers a vehicle that cannot be stolen or devalued, freeing churches to give directly without middle‑man extraction. Throughout the session, Scripture (Deuteronomy 15, Isaiah 65, Luke 16‑17, etc.) is woven into a theology that frames money as a tool for service, not a master; that generosity, time‑preferential freedom, and honest measurement are the true spiritual virtues. The discussion culminates in a vision of the Kingdom, where the love of money is abandoned, labor is joyful, and a universal, non‑state‑controlled money (Bitcoin) enables Christians to live out the command to love God first, love neighbors, and work for the kingdom.</p>

      <p>In Week 5 the group pulls together all the lessons from the series—highlighting how Bitcoin’s finite, deflationary nature contrasts with real‑estate’s speculative value, why tithing in Bitcoin eliminates middle‑man theft, and how a low‑time‑preference mindset supports generosity, legacy, and true stewardship. The session offers a concise, faith‑centered recap and practical next steps for believers to take ownership of their money and honor God in every transaction.</p>

The session ends with a heartfelt prayer and an invitation for anyone to step into the gospel—one small step at a time.</p>
